# 🏋️ AL Workout Website

Greetings, my name is **Phefry** and this is my project: **AL Workout** – a dark-themed fitness training website built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project showcases a sleek user interface with interactive elements and a green-accented call-to-action system.

## 🔥 Project Description

**AL Workout** is a single-page fitness website designed to inspire and support physical training enthusiasts. It features:

- 💪 A **dark mode** layout for a modern, high-contrast user experience.
- ✅ A **green button highlight effect** when clicked, providing immediate visual feedback.
- 📱 A responsive design that looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## 🎨 Design & Color Inspiration

The design follows a **dark aesthetic** for these reasons:

- Reduces eye strain in low-light environments.
- Gives a professional and intense vibe suited for workout themes.
- Creates contrast with **green accents**, which symbolize energy, strength, and vitality.

### 💚 Green Buttons
- The green glow on button clicks reinforces action, motivation, and forward motion.
- This color combo (dark + green) was chosen for both visual clarity and psychological effect.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Language | Purpose                      |
|----------|------------------------------|
| HTML     | Structure of the web page    |
| CSS      | Styling (Dark mode, layout, responsiveness) |

## 🚀 How It Works

- The main layout is crafted with **HTML5** semantic elements.
- **CSS** handles dark background colors, spacing, and responsive flexbox/grid layouts.
- **JavaScript** adds click functionality:
  - When a user clicks a button, it changes color to green momentarily or permanently, depending on the intended behavior.
